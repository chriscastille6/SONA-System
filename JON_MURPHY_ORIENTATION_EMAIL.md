# Orientation Email for Jon Murphy - IRB Review Requests

**Subject:** IRB Review Request: Protocol Updates and New Study Approval

---

**To:** Dr. Jon Murphy  
**From:** Dr. Christopher Castille  
**Date:** [Current Date]  
**Re:** IRB Review Requests - Conjoint Analysis Protocol Update & EI/Fluid Intelligence Study Approval

---

Dear Dr. Murphy,

I hope this email finds you well. As the IRB College Representative for the College of Business Administration, I am writing to request your review and approval of two items:

## 1. Updated Protocol for Conjoint Analysis Project

I am requesting approval for a protocol modification to the **Theory of Optimal Fringe Benefits Using Conjoint Analysis** study (Protocol Number: IRBE20251031-005CBA). 

**Proposed Change:**
I would like to add an additional measure to the protocol: the **Loss Aversion Inventory (LAI)**. This assessment is available at:
https://bayoupal.nicholls.edu/platform/assessment-flow.html?assessment=lai

The LAI will provide valuable data on participants' loss aversion tendencies, which is directly relevant to understanding how individuals make trade-offs in the conjoint analysis choice tasks. This addition will enhance our understanding of the decision-making processes underlying the total rewards optimization exercise.

**Current Protocol Status:**
- Protocol Number: IRBE20251031-005CBA
- Review Type: Exempt
- Status: Approved (October 31, 2025)
- PI: Dr. Martin Meder
- Co-Investigator: Dr. Christopher Castille

I have prepared the updated protocol documentation and can provide it for your review. The modification is minimal and does not change the core procedures or risk level of the study.

## 2. Approval Request: Emotional Intelligence and Fluid Intelligence Study

I am requesting approval for a new study: **Emotional Intelligence and Fluid Intelligence Study**. This study examines the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and fluid intelligence as measured by Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM).

**Study Overview:**
- **Purpose:** To test whether there is a fluid emotional intelligence that is separate and distinct from crystallized IQ
- **Participants:** Undergraduate students enrolled in psychology and business courses at Nicholls State University (18+ years old)
- **Duration:** Approximately 30-40 minutes
- **Procedures:** 
  - Self-estimates of EI abilities
  - Video-based emotional intelligence assessment
  - Raven's Progressive Matrices (fluid intelligence test)
  - Comparison of self-perceptions with actual performance
  - Immediate feedback to participants

**Feedback Reports for Review:**

As part of the approval process, I would like to provide you with sample feedback reports that participants will receive. These reports include:

1. **Percentile Feedback:** Participants receive their percentile scores across multiple EI domains (self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship management)
2. **Bias Visualization:** Comparison of self-estimates versus actual performance (Dunning-Kruger effect analysis)
3. **Radar Charts:** Visual representation of performance across EI domains

I can provide you with:
- Sample feedback screenshots showing what participants see
- Example feedback reports with different performance levels
- The debriefing materials participants receive at the end of the study

**Access to Review Materials:**

You can access the protocol submission and review materials through the PRAMS system:
- **Admin Panel:** https://bayoupal.nicholls.edu/hsirb/admin/
- **Researcher Dashboard:** https://bayoupal.nicholls.edu/hsirb/studies/researcher/

I can also provide direct links to the protocol submission once it is entered into the system, or I can share the materials via email if you prefer.

## Next Steps

I would be happy to:
1. Schedule a brief meeting to walk through the protocol updates and new study materials
2. Provide the feedback report samples via email or through the PRAMS system
3. Answer any questions you may have about either study

Please let me know your preferred method of review and if you need any additional information or documentation.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to working with you on these IRB reviews.

Best regards,

Dr. Christopher Castille
