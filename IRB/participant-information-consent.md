## Overview

This platform provides access to psychological assessments for educational and self-reflection purposes. This document explains your options for using the platform and, separately, your options for participating in research.

**Important:** Your use of the platform's assessments and tools is completely separate from any decision to participate in research. You may use all platform features without participating in research, and you may participate in research without using all platform features.

## Platform Features

### 1. Psychological Assessments

The platform offers standardized psychological assessments, including:

- **Emotional Intelligence Assessment:** Measures your ability to recognize, understand, regulate, and manage emotions through situational judgment tasks and facial recognition exercises.

- **Raven's Progressive Matrices:** Measures fluid intelligence and pattern recognition abilities through abstract reasoning tasks.

**Assessment Results:**
- All assessment results are **non-diagnostic** and are not used for academic, employment, or evaluative decisions.
- Results are **probabilistic and descriptive**, intended for self-reflection and learning.
- Results should not be interpreted as fixed traits or comprehensive evaluations of your abilities.
- Results may vary across time and contexts.

### 2. Standardized Feedback

After completing an assessment, you will receive standardized feedback that:
- Provides descriptive information about your performance relative to normative samples
- Explains what your scores mean in practical terms
- Offers general guidance for self-reflection and development
- Does not provide clinical, diagnostic, or therapeutic interpretations

### 3. Optional AI-Based Coaching Tool (Forthcoming)

A forthcoming optional tool will provide AI-generated coaching focused on:
- Personal effectiveness and self-management
- Career development guidance
- Self-reflection exercises

**Important Limitations:**
- This tool is **not** mental health treatment, clinical advice, or diagnosis
- This tool does **not** provide therapeutic services
- AI-generated feedback includes appropriate uncertainty and should not be treated as authoritative psychological judgment
- Access to this tool requires a personalized account and may involve fees

**Your Choice:** You may use assessments and feedback without using the AI coaching tool. Your decision to use or not use the AI coaching tool has no effect on your access to assessments, feedback, or any other platform features.

## Research Participation (Separate and Voluntary)

### What is Research Participation?

Research participation means allowing your anonymized assessment data to be used for scientific research purposes. This is **completely separate** from using the platform's assessments and tools.

### Your Options

You have four independent choices:

1. **Use platform features AND participate in research**
2. **Use platform features WITHOUT participating in research**
3. **Participate in research WITHOUT using all platform features**
4. **Neither use platform features nor participate in research**

**No penalties or consequences:** Your choices have no effect on:
- Your access to assessments
- Your access to feedback
- Your access to AI coaching tools (if available)
- Any compensation you may receive
- Any pricing or fees
- Any services provided

### What Research Participation Involves

If you choose to participate in research:
- Your assessment responses will be de-identified using randomized participant IDs
- No names, email addresses, or direct identifiers will be stored with your assessment data
- Only data from participants who explicitly consent will be included in research datasets
- Research data will be used to advance scientific understanding of psychological assessment and human behavior

### Consent for Research

If you choose to participate in research, you will be asked to provide separate, explicit consent for each assessment. This consent process:
- Occurs separately from assessment completion
- Occurs separately from tool usage decisions
- Clearly explains what data will be used for research
- Allows you to consent for some assessments but not others

**Your Right to Withdraw:** You may withdraw your research participation at any time without penalty. Withdrawing from research does not affect your access to platform features.
