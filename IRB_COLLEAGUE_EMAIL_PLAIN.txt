Subject: Demo: Research Participant Management System with IRB Automation - Review Request

================================================================================

Hi [Colleague Name],

I hope this email finds you well! I wanted to share an exciting development we've been working on here at Nicholls State University: a comprehensive research participant recruitment and management system with integrated IRB automation tools.

Given your expertise in research ethics and IRB processes, I'd greatly appreciate your feedback on the system from both an administrative perspective (IRB oversight) and a practical perspective (how it impacts researchers and participants).

RETURN ON INVESTMENT (ROI)
================================================================================

COST COMPARISON:
                           Annual Cost    5-Year Cost
Commercial SONA Systems    $3,000-5,000   $15,000-25,000
This Open-Source System    $300-720       $1,500-3,600
University Infrastructure  $0             $0

SAVINGS: $13,500-25,000 over 5 years (or $25,000 with university VM)

ADDITIONAL BENEFITS:
- Complete data control (all data on university servers)
- FERPA compliance (no third-party data sharing)
- Customization to meet institutional needs
- No per-user fees (unlimited researchers and participants)
- Open source (no vendor lock-in, full transparency)

TIME SAVINGS (Annual for 50 studies):
- IRB Applications: 100 hours saved (2 hrs × 50 studies)
- Participant Management: 200 hours saved
- Credit Tracking: 75 hours saved (automated vs. manual)
- Email Reminders: 50 hours saved (automated notifications)

Total Annual Time Savings: ~425 hours (~$12,750 value at $30/hr)

TOTAL 5-YEAR ROI: $25,000+ in cost savings + $63,750 in time savings = $88,750+

From an IRB perspective, I'd particularly value your thoughts on:

1. CONSENT PROCESS - Is the consent workflow clear and compliant?
2. DATA SECURITY - Are the privacy protections sufficient?
3. AUDIT CAPABILITY - Can IRB staff easily verify study compliance?
4. PARTICIPANT RIGHTS - Is withdrawal/cancellation sufficiently accessible?
5. RECORD KEEPING - Does the system maintain adequate documentation?
6. RISK MANAGEMENT - Are there any ethical concerns with the workflow?
7. IRB INTEGRATION - What additional features would help IRB oversight?

As someone with deep expertise in research ethics and IRB processes, your
perspective is invaluable. This system has the potential to:

- Enhance compliance through better tracking and documentation
- Reduce administrative burden on researchers and IRB staff
- Improve participant experience with streamlined processes
- Save institutional resources compared to commercial alternatives
- Increase research transparency via OSF integration

Your feedback will help ensure the system meets the highest ethical standards
while serving the practical needs of our research community.

================================================================================

The demo system is running now and available whenever convenient for you. If
you'd like to schedule a brief walkthrough together (15-20 minutes), I'm happy
to do so - just let me know what works with your schedule.
