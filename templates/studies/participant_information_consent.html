                <h2 class="h5 mt-4">Overview</h2>
                <p>This platform provides access to psychological assessments for educational and self-reflection purposes. This document explains your options for using the platform and, separately, your options for participating in research.</p>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Your use of the platform's assessments and tools is completely separate from any decision to participate in research. You may use all platform features without participating in research, and you may participate in research without using all platform features.</p>

                <h2 class="h5 mt-4">Platform Features</h2>
                <h3 class="h6 mt-3">1. Psychological Assessments</h3>
                <p>The platform offers standardized psychological assessments, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Emotional Intelligence Assessment:</strong> Measures your ability to recognize, understand, regulate, and manage emotions through situational judgment tasks and facial recognition exercises.</li>
                    <li><strong>Raven's Progressive Matrices:</strong> Measures fluid intelligence and pattern recognition abilities through abstract reasoning tasks.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>All assessment results are <strong>non-diagnostic</strong> and are not used for academic, employment, or evaluative decisions.</li>
                    <li>Results are <strong>probabilistic and descriptive</strong>, intended for self-reflection and learning.</li>
                    <li>Results should not be interpreted as fixed traits or comprehensive evaluations of your abilities.</li>
                    <li>Results may vary across time and contexts.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="h6 mt-3">2. Standardized Feedback</h3>
                <p>After completing an assessment, you will receive standardized feedback that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provides descriptive information about your performance relative to normative samples</li>
                    <li>Explains what your scores mean in practical terms</li>
                    <li>Offers general guidance for self-reflection and development</li>
                    <li>Does not provide clinical, diagnostic, or therapeutic interpretations</li>

                <h3 class="h6 mt-3">What is Research Participation?</h3>
                <p>Research participation means allowing your anonymized assessment data to be used for scientific research purposes. This is <strong>completely separate</strong> from using the platform's assessments and tools.</p>

                <h3 class="h6 mt-3">Your Options</h3>
                <p>You have four independent choices:</p>
                <ol>

                </ol>
                <p><strong>No penalties or consequences:</strong> Your choices have no effect on: your access to assessments; your access to feedback; your access to AI coaching tools (if available); any compensation you may receive; any pricing or fees; any services provided.</p>

                <p>If you choose to participate in research, you will be asked to provide separate, explicit consent for each assessment. This consent process:</p>

                    <li>Occurs separately from assessment completion</li>
