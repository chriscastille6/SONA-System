# ðŸš‚ Railway Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy to Railway (5 minutes)

Railway is a free hosting platform perfect for sharing your SONA demo. Your app will get a permanent public URL like `https://sona-system.railway.app`

---

## Step 1: Create Railway Account

1. Go to **https://railway.app**
2. Click **"Start a New Project"** or **"Login"**
3. Sign up with GitHub (recommended) or email

---

## Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

You need to push your code to GitHub first (Railway deploys from GitHub):

### Option A: Using GitHub Desktop (Easiest)
1. Download **GitHub Desktop** from https://desktop.github.com
2. Open GitHub Desktop
3. Click **File â†’ Add Local Repository**
4. Select your SONA System folder
5. Click **Publish repository**
6. Uncheck "Keep this code private" (or keep it private, your choice)
7. Click **Publish Repository**

### Option B: Using Command Line
```bash
# 1. Create a new repository on GitHub.com (click the + button)
# Name it: SONA-System

# 2. Add the remote and push:
cd "/Users/ccastille/Documents/GitHub/SONA System"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SONA-System.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## Step 3: Deploy on Railway

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard:** https://railway.app/dashboard

2. **Click "New Project"**

3. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**

4. **Choose your SONA-System repository**

5. **Railway will automatically detect Django and start deploying!**

---

## Step 4: Add PostgreSQL Database

1. In your Railway project, click **"+ New"**

2. Select **"Database" â†’ "PostgreSQL"**

3. Railway automatically links it to your Django app! âœ¨

---

## Step 5: Set Environment Variables

Click on your Django service, then go to **"Variables"** tab:

### Required Variables:

```bash
DEBUG=False
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here-make-it-long-and-random
ALLOWED_HOSTS=.railway.app
```

### Optional (but recommended):

```bash
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL=admin@nicholls.edu
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=changeme123
```

**Tip:** Railway automatically provides `DATABASE_URL` from the PostgreSQL service!

---

## Step 6: Wait for Deployment

Railway will:
1. âœ… Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
2. âœ… Run database migrations
3. âœ… Collect static files
4. âœ… **Automatically load demo data!** (via Procfile)
5. âœ… Start the server

This takes about 2-3 minutes.

---

## Step 7: Get Your Public URL

1. Once deployed, go to **"Settings"** tab
2. Scroll to **"Domains"**
3. Click **"Generate Domain"**
4. Railway will give you a URL like: `https://sona-system-production.railway.app`

**ðŸŽ‰ That's your shareable demo link!**

---

## Step 8: Share with Your Colleague

Send them:
- **URL:** Your Railway domain
- **Login credentials:**
  - Researcher: researcher@nicholls.edu / demo123
  - Instructor: instructor@nicholls.edu / demo123
  - Student: emily.johnson@my.nicholls.edu / demo123

The demo data is automatically loaded, so they can start exploring immediately!

---

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Build Failed?

Check the logs in Railway dashboard. Common issues:

1. **Missing SECRET_KEY**: Add it in Variables tab
2. **Database error**: Make sure PostgreSQL service is added
3. **Port error**: Railway automatically sets PORT, you don't need to configure it

### Need to Update Code?

Just push to GitHub:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Updated something"
git push
```

Railway automatically redeploys! ðŸš€

# Create project and deploy
railway init
railway up
railway open
```
