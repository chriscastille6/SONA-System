\textbf{REQUEST FOR NON-EXEMPT REVIEW BY HUMAN SUBJECTS INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD}
\end{center}

Nicholls State University has established standards and guidelines to ensure adequate protection is provided to individuals participating in a research activity. The Human Subjects Institutional Review Board (HSIRB) is charged with the responsibility of screening all research which employs human participants conducted by faculty, administrators, or students affiliated with Nicholls State University. The guidelines employed for screening are those set forth by university policy. Please fill in all requested information and return two copies of this form and any supporting documentation to the HSIRB chair or your college HSIRB representative.

**Procedure:**

1. The primary investigator (Referred to as the "applicant") planning a research activity involving human subjects, should obtain a Request for HSIRB application form from the college HSIRB representative or HSIRB Chairperson. Research originating from other institutions should be approved by the host institution prior to applying for approval at Nicholls State University.

2. The Applicant should submit two copies of the completed forms to the college HSIRB representative. An initial review of the application will be made by the college HSIRB representative to determine if the project is considered Category I, EXEMPT, Category II, EXPEDITED REVIEW, or Category III, FULL COMMITTEE REVIEW. If the determination of the college HSIRB representative is that the application warrants an EXEMPT or EXPEDITED REVIEW determination, the Applicant may begin the research project. If the College HSIRB representative determines that the proposed research requires a FULL COMMITTEE REVIEW, the Applicant will be requested to submit ten copies of the application to the HSIRB Chairperson. The college HSIRB representative may not disapprove an application. Disapproval of proposed research involving human subjects may only be determined by the full HSIRB.

3. Applications may be submitted to the college HSIRB representative at any time, however, applications which will require a review by the full HSIRB must be submitted to the Chairperson of the HSIRB by the 20th of each month.

## 1. Description of Project or Proposal

### Population of Human Subjects

The population for this study consists exclusively of undergraduate students enrolled in Dr. Martin Meder's Labor Economics course at Nicholls State University. Participation is **VOLUNTARY** and students must be 18 or older. This exercise is only available to students in this specific course who have received the necessary background instruction in labor economics concepts.

### Research Procedures and Data Collection

This is an educational classroom exercise designed to teach students about conjoint analysis and total rewards optimization within the context of Dr. Meder's Labor Economics course. The exercise will be conducted as follows:

1. **Introduction and Consent**: Students will receive a brief introduction explaining they are participating in a Total Rewards Optimization project as part of their Labor Economics coursework.

2. **Role-Playing Scenario**: Students will be asked to imagine they are employees at "Firm Co." who enjoy their job but would like to receive better treatment. They are participating in a Total Rewards Optimization project to identify new employee rewards their employer would be willing to pay for.

3. **Choice Tasks**: Students will complete 8 choice tasks where they select between pairs of job scenarios. Each scenario presents changes from a \$64K baseline compensation package. Due to financial pressure, all options represent a \$5K reduction to \$59K total compensation, with different allocations across four attributes:
   - **Salary**: Ranging from \$37.5K to \$42.5K (compared to \$45K baseline)
   - **Training Budget**: \$1K to \$5K per employee (compared to \$2.5K baseline)
   - **Manager Quality**: Average vs Good (with associated cost trade-offs)
   - **Work Flexibility**: Onsite, Hybrid, Remote (with associated cost trade-offs)
   
   Students see only the changes from baseline, color-coded green for gains and red for losses, helping them understand the cost constraint trade-offs.

4. **Turnover Probability Assessment**: After completing choice tasks, students will report the probability (0-100%) that they would stay with the company for the next year for four different packages: baseline, their preferred choice, a training-focused package, and a manager-focused package.

5. **Wait Page and Group Work**: Students wait for further instructions, then work in small groups to design a new benefit package they think would be acceptable to most students in the class, considering the \$59K cost constraint.

6. **Final Choice Round**: Students choose between their baseline, their preferred choice, and the focus group packages, then answer final retention questions.

7. **Exercise Evaluation**: Students complete a comprehensive assessment rating:
   - How interesting they found the exercise (1-5 scale)
   - How useful it was for understanding measuring employee preferences (1-5 scale)
   - Whether they would recommend this process to employers (1-5 scale)
   - How the exercise helped them understand economic concepts (1-5 scale)
   - How the exercise helped them understand labor economics relevance to business (1-5 scale)
   - How the discussion helped them understand economic concepts (1-5 scale)
   - How the discussion helped them understand labor economics relevance to business (1-5 scale)
   - How cross-teaching helped them understand labor economics integration (1-5 scale)
   - Optional comments

8. **Results Discussion**: Students will view class-wide results showing preference patterns and business impact calculations, followed by discussion of how these concepts relate to labor economics theory covered in the course.

**Data Collection Method**: Online survey administered through:

- Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript application (student_survey.html) - Current version: September 2025
- Mobile-responsive design for smartphone and tablet use
- Platform: Local server or web hosting
- Data storage: Anonymous responses stored locally in browser

The exercise takes approximately 30 minutes to complete and will be conducted during a regular class session of Dr. Meder's Labor Economics course.

### Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this educational exercise are:

1. **Educational Goal**: To help undergraduate students in Labor Economics understand how conjoint analysis can be used as an application of the theory of optimal fringe benefits to quantify employee preferences and inform total rewards decisions, connecting theoretical labor economics concepts to practical HR applications.

2. **Applied Learning**: To demonstrate how employee preferences translate to business value through turnover cost analysis and ROI calculations, reinforcing labor market theory with real-world applications.

3. **Practical Application**: To show students how people analytics can inform HR decision-making in real organizational contexts, bridging the gap between economic theory and business practice.

**Research Questions**: This is primarily an educational exercise rather than hypothesis-driven research. However, the exercise will generate data that could be used to explore:

- Which total rewards attributes are most important to students
- How preferences vary across demographic groups  
- The relationship between job satisfaction and turnover intentions
- How student preferences align with labor economics theory
- The effectiveness of interdisciplinary teaching approaches
- The impact of collaborative learning on economic concept understanding

**Educational Justification**: This exercise is specifically designed for students who have received instruction in labor economics concepts and can meaningfully engage with the theoretical framework underlying the choice tasks. Students outside of Dr. Meder's course would not have the necessary background knowledge to participate meaningfully in this exercise.
