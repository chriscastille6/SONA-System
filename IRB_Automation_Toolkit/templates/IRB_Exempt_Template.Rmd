---

## 4. Description of Project or Proposal

### Population of Human Subjects
The population for this study consists exclusively of undergraduate students enrolled in Dr. Martin Meder's Labor Economics course at Nicholls State University. Participation is **VOLUNTARY** and students must be 18 or older. This exercise is only available to students in this specific course who have received the necessary background instruction in labor economics concepts.

### Research Procedures and Data Collection
This is an educational classroom exercise designed to teach students about conjoint analysis and total rewards optimization within the context of Dr. Meder's Labor Economics course. The exercise will be conducted as follows:

1. **Introduction and Consent**: Students will receive a brief introduction explaining they are participating in a Total Rewards Optimization project as part of their Labor Economics coursework.

2. **Role-Playing Scenario**: Students will be asked to imagine they are employees at "Firm Co." who enjoy their job but would like to receive better treatment. They are participating in a Total Rewards Optimization project to identify new employee rewards their employer would be willing to pay for.

3. **Choice Tasks**: Students will complete 8 choice tasks where they select between pairs of job scenarios. Each scenario presents changes from a $64K baseline compensation package. Due to financial pressure, all options represent a $5K reduction to $59K total compensation, with different allocations across four attributes:
   - **Salary**: Ranging from $37.5K to $42.5K (compared to $45K baseline)
   - **Training Budget**: $1K to $5K per employee (compared to $2.5K baseline)
   - **Manager Quality**: Average vs Good (with associated cost trade-offs)
   - **Work Flexibility**: Onsite, Hybrid, Remote (with associated cost trade-offs)
   
   Students see only the changes from baseline, color-coded green for gains and red for losses, helping them understand the cost constraint trade-offs.

4. **Turnover Probability Assessment**: After completing choice tasks, students will report the probability (0-100%) that they would stay with the company for the next year for four different packages: baseline, their preferred choice, a training-focused package, and a manager-focused package.

5. **Wait Page and Group Work**: Students wait for further instructions, then work in small groups to design a new benefit package they think would be acceptable to most students in the class, considering the $59K cost constraint.

6. **Final Choice Round**: Students choose between their baseline, their preferred choice, and the focus group packages, then answer final retention questions.

7. **Exercise Evaluation**: Students complete a comprehensive assessment rating:
   - How interesting they found the exercise (1-5 scale)
   - How useful it was for understanding measuring employee preferences (1-5 scale)
   - Whether they would recommend this process to employers (1-5 scale)
   - How the exercise helped them understand economic concepts (1-5 scale)
   - How the exercise helped them understand labor economics relevance to business (1-5 scale)
   - How the discussion helped them understand economic concepts (1-5 scale)
   - How the discussion helped them understand labor economics relevance to business (1-5 scale)
   - How cross-teaching helped them understand labor economics integration (1-5 scale)
   - Optional comments

6. **Results Discussion**: Students will view class-wide results showing preference patterns and business impact calculations, followed by discussion of how these concepts relate to labor economics theory covered in the course.

**Data Collection Method**: Online survey administered through:
- Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript application (student_survey.html) - Current version: September 2025
- Mobile-responsive design for smartphone and tablet use
- Platform: Local server or web hosting
- Data storage: Anonymous responses stored locally in browser

The exercise takes approximately 30 minutes to complete and will be conducted during a regular class session of Dr. Meder's Labor Economics course.

### Research Objectives
The primary objectives of this educational exercise are:

1. **Educational Goal**: To help undergraduate students in Labor Economics understand how conjoint analysis can be used as an application of the theory of optimal fringe benefits to quantify employee preferences and inform total rewards decisions, connecting theoretical labor economics concepts to practical HR applications.

2. **Applied Learning**: To demonstrate how employee preferences translate to business value through turnover cost analysis and ROI calculations, reinforcing labor market theory with real-world applications.

3. **Practical Application**: To show students how people analytics can inform HR decision-making in real organizational contexts, bridging the gap between economic theory and business practice.

**Research Questions**: This is primarily an educational exercise rather than hypothesis-driven research. However, the exercise will generate data that could be used to explore:
- Which total rewards attributes are most important to students
- How preferences vary across demographic groups  
- The relationship between job satisfaction and turnover intentions
- How student preferences align with labor economics theory
- The effectiveness of interdisciplinary teaching approaches
- The impact of collaborative learning on economic concept understanding

**Educational Justification**: This exercise is specifically designed for students who have received instruction in labor economics concepts and can meaningfully engage with the theoretical framework underlying the choice tasks. Students outside of Dr. Meder's course would not have the necessary background knowledge to participate meaningfully in this exercise.

## 5. Recruitment

### How will you recruit subjects?
Students will be recruited exclusively through in-class announcements during Dr. Martin Meder's Labor Economics course sessions. The instructor will explain that participation in the exercise is voluntary and part of the course curriculum. No recruitment will occur outside of this specific course.

**Recruitment Script:**
"Today we're going to do an interactive exercise to learn how one might apply the theory of optimal fringe benefits using conjoint analysis and total optimization as part of our Labor Economics course. You'll be asked to imagine you're an employee evaluating different job scenarios. This exercise is voluntary and will help you understand how companies make decisions about employee benefits and how this relates to labor market theory we've been studying. The exercise takes about 30 minutes and we'll discuss the results as a class."

### Criteria for Including Subjects
- Undergraduate students enrolled in Dr. Martin Meder's Labor Economics course
- Students who have received instruction in relevant labor economics concepts
- Age 18 or older
- Voluntary participation

### Criteria for Excluding Subjects
- Students not enrolled in Dr. Martin Meder's Labor Economics course
- Students who have not received the necessary background instruction in labor economics concepts
- Students under age 18
