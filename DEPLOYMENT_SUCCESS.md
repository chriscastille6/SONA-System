## 📈 Performance Notes

### Current Configuration:
- **Development Server**: Not optimized for production
- **SQLite**: Single-user database (perfect for testing)
- **Static Files**: Served directly (not CDN)
- **No Caching**: Full database queries each request

### For Production:
- Use PostgreSQL for multi-user access
- Use Gunicorn + Nginx for web serving
- Use Redis for Celery task queue
- Enable caching and compression
- Set DEBUG=False
