Subject: Demo: Research Participant System with IRB Automation ($88K+ ROI)

Hi [Colleague Name],

I'd like your expert feedback on a research participant management system we've developed at Nicholls. Given your IRB expertise, I'm particularly interested in your assessment of our compliance features and ethical safeguards.

===============================================================================
DEMO ACCESS (Available Now)
===============================================================================

System: https://nichollsirb.up.railway.app
Admin: https://nichollsirb.up.railway.app/admin/

CREDENTIALS (all use password: demo123):
• Researcher: researcher@nicholls.edu
• Participant: emily.johnson@my.nicholls.edu  
• IRB Admin: admin@university.edu

===============================================================================
WHY THIS MATTERS FOR IRB
===============================================================================

✓ IRB Status Tracking - Real-time approval status, protocol numbers, expiration alerts
✓ Consent Management - Versioned consent forms with complete audit trail
✓ Data Protection - Role-based access, anonymous responses, full audit logs
✓ Ethical Research - Bayesian monitoring for early stopping, minimizes participant burden
✓ Complete Oversight - CSV exports, participation statistics, transaction audits

BONUS: IRB Automation Toolkit saves ~2 hours per application (automated screenshots, document generation, Nicholls HSIRB formatting)

===============================================================================
ROI SUMMARY
===============================================================================

5-Year Cost Comparison:
• Commercial SONA: $15,000-25,000
• This System: $1,500-3,600 (or $0 on university infrastructure)
• SAVINGS: $13,500-25,000

Time Savings: ~425 hours/year for 50 studies (~$12,750/year value)

TOTAL 5-YEAR ROI: $88,750+

Additional Benefits: Complete data control, FERPA compliance, no vendor lock-in, unlimited users, full customization

===============================================================================
15-MINUTE GUIDED TOUR
===============================================================================

See attached PDF tutorial for detailed walkthrough of:

1. RESEARCHER VIEW (5 min) - Study dashboard, IRB tracking, attendance, protocol responses
2. PARTICIPANT VIEW (5 min) - Study browsing, consent process, booking, credit tracking  
3. IRB ADMIN VIEW (5 min) - Oversight dashboard, audit trails, compliance verification

Demo includes realistic data: 1 IRB-approved study, 45 timeslots, 23 signups with attendance history, 12 protocol responses, complete audit trail.

===============================================================================
YOUR FEEDBACK REQUESTED
===============================================================================

As an IRB expert, I'd particularly value your thoughts on:

1. Is the consent workflow compliant and accessible?
2. Are privacy protections and data security adequate?
3. Can IRB staff easily verify study compliance?
4. Is participant withdrawal sufficiently clear?
5. Does record-keeping meet documentation requirements?
6. What additional features would strengthen IRB oversight?

===============================================================================
NEXT STEPS
===============================================================================

1. Try the 15-minute demo using credentials above (tutorial attached)
2. Review from both researcher and IRB administrator perspectives
3. Share your feedback on compliance, ethics, and potential improvements

I'm happy to schedule a brief walkthrough together if helpful (15-20 min). The system is running now and available whenever convenient for you.

Your perspective will help ensure this system meets the highest ethical standards while providing substantial cost savings and efficiency gains for our research community.

Thank you for your time and expertise!
